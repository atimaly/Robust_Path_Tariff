# Robust_Path_Tariff
Robust Bilevel Solution for determining highway's tariff for profit maxmization.

If you want to run the program do the following steps:
1. Run "cmake .." and "make" in the build directory.
2. If you just want to run the solver with a randomly generated instance run "./robust_path_tariff". In this case the randomly generated case will be saved into "generated_test.txt"
3. If you already have an instance then run "./robust_path_tariff /path/to/instance.txt".
